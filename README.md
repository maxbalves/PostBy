## Overview
### Description
App allows users to see and create posts for their timeline. Each timeline will display the most recently created posts. App will allow users to open a map and see where exactly each post originated from. The idea of the app is that users will be able to leave posts behind, wherever they explore.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking
- **Mobile:** Mobile is important because the app will be a social networking platform that users can quickly check and engage on. The mobile phone's location will be important for the app's features.
- **Story:** Users will be able to see posts from users around the world, which can create more community, allow for meetups, and create local entertainment.
- **Market:** Any individual with a mobile phone is able to benefit from the app for their own entertainment.
- **Habit:** The app can be used daily in order to see new messages and the posts around the user. It could create a habit of checking/creating posts everyday.
- **Scope:** On the most basic level, the app will demonstrate a timeline for creating and viewing posts and showing pins of where the posts where made. Users will be able to sort their timeline by newest or trending posts nearby.

## Difficult/Ambiguous Technical Problems
- Complex data models that implement relations in order for faster retrieval and deletion of data
    - User <-> Posts
    - User <-> Liked Posts
    - User <-> Disliked Posts
    - User <-> Comments
    - other examples can be found in Schema above...
- Privacy concern handling
    - Users can hide location, username, and profile picture on their posts
    - They also have the option to change those decisions later on
    - Users can delete all of their data (posts, likes, dislikes, comments, and account) through the settings page
- Filter and ranking features for posts
    - Only posts within a 5-mile radius are queried for timeline
    - When the map is refreshed, a rectangle based on the southwest and northeast coordinates of the map that the user sees is created to query posts only within that area
- Handling of edge cases with Like/Dislike feature
    - Changes made locally overwrite those currently stored in Parse DB if the post is not up to date
    - Example:
        - User likes a post from home page
        - Then, through maps, the user dislikes the same post by going to its details screen
        - Back in home page, the user then unlikes the same post again (which is not updated)
        - Result: the post locally will be disliked and will overwrite the previous choice that was stored in Parse. The most updated post will now be disliked too.
